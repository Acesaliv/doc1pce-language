# doc1pce-language
Extension for doc1pce syntax highlighting.

Recomended also the "CodeMap" Extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oleg-shilo.codemap) with a user defined syntax in "settings.json" to identify list of procedures:

    "codemap.src": [
        {
          "pattern": "begin procedure <\\w+>",
          "icon": "function"
        }
    ],
